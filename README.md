# JavaScript: Week 4: Reflection and Development.

#### **Angular Application: I want to make an Angular Application that so I can better understand the flow of data, and the ability to have to ability to not feel so uncomfortable with it! I really want to learn how to do everything that I could do with jQuery in Angular and I especially want to keep the knowledge I learn today to better help me understand React and the MVC system of programming.**

#### **In addition I would like to work on my ability to talk to other people in the tech community in Portland, I have gone to only a few meet-ups since I started to go to Epicodus and if I want to be apart of the community and eventually get a job, I feel like I need to do a better job of reaching out and talking with people i meet. **

#### So, my goals for today are as follows:
  1. Research some meet-up events through calgator, eventbrite and meetup.com to try and do a better job of being apart of the Portland Tech community.
  2. Study and do research about how to implement an API call through an Angular App - and learn more helpful fundamentals about how to user firebase with my Angular application.
    - learn how to save "favorites" from API's JSON file into firebase. Seems pretty cool!
    - spend more time making a dynamic routes and learning how to transfer information through services.

### I signed for four different meetups in the next month to try and get out and meet people!
  1. Monday January 29th - Programmer Peer Mentoring Night at PDX Code Guild
  2. Wednesday, January 31st - Portland Javascript Admirers' Monthly Meeting
  3. Thurs, February 8th - Code Oregon Careers: Soft Skills Interviewing at Tech Academy Portland
  4. Monday, February 12, Futuretalks PDX - Creating a culture of Inclusion and Equity in Tech.

  ### Next, I am going to be going through different tutorials on youtube to help me learn a but more on Angular and how I could complete that application that I listed above, more about RegEx (i have no idea how to use it) and I will post any pertinent details below:
    1. NetNinja video of HTTP services and both the .map and .subscribe method
    2. More about Firebase and connecting it to your Angular application
    3. Team Treehouse course on RegEx
      - RegEx needs both a pattern and string to parse each expression.
